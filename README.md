**ASSIGNMENT DISCRIPTION**

Smart Home Website: Content
Before you begin, create a new GitHub repo named 'smart-home-content'.

Using the "Amenities List" for the home from There Will Come Soft Rains you will create and markup content for a four (4) page marketing website about a smart home. The website will consist of a 'home' page offering captivating imagery and a summary of the home and it's features, along with three (3) additional 'pages' (HTML documents) that organize all of the listed amenities into categories of your choosing. Each category should include "product descriptions"* and images of each feature in the category.
- Each page should make use of semantic HTML5 markup tags. Examples include: header, nav, main, footer, section, and article tags
- GenAI **may** be used to produce product descriptions and images for the fictitious portions of our home. AI ***may not*** be used to write any of your code/markup.
- All AI text should be edited to preserve the same **'voice'** throughout your website content.

**Focus on semantic markup and content. Do not style this website. We will use this content only site to learn about design and style in future classes.**

**"Product Description"** is a piece of marketing copy [writing] that explains what a product is and why it's worth buying. It's a short online sales pitch that informs potential customers about a product's features and benefits so they can make an informed buying decision.

**"Voice"** in writing refers to the unique style, personality, and perspective that an author brings to their work, essentially how their individual "voice" comes through on the page through their word choice, sentence structure, tone, and overall writing style, making their writing distinct from others.

See the attached link for more on "voice" as it pertains to writing.

Additional link attached as a starting point to research how homes are marketed, I encourage you search for and review additional home builder websites across the USA to become familiar with consumer expectations for your website.
